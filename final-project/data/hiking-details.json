During World War II, the hill housed a military detachment, as there was concern that German submarines were circulating in those waters. The information was transmitted via radio through a generator, which led the population to give the name by which the hill is known to this day. Telégrafo Hill actually has four viewpoints, each offering “amazing” views."
