            The Caterpillar and <span>Alice</span> looked at each other for some time in silence: at
            last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a
            languid, sleepy voice.

            Click anywhere on the screen or press any key to toggle the
            <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> between hidden and showing.

          <div>
            This is a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element that animates between
            <code>display: none; opacity: 0</code> and
            <code>display: block; opacity: 1</code>. Neat, huh?
          </div>
          
          <p>
            This is another paragraph to show that <code>display: none;</code> is being
            applied and removed on the above <code>&lt;div&gt; </code>. If only its
            <code>opacity</code> was being changed, it would always take up the space in
            the DOM.
